# Epic: project-optimization

## Overview
Technical implementation plan for comprehensive optimization of ZtbAi智能投标助手 project, including code cleanup, test file removal, startup optimization, and Chinese documentation standardization.

## Architecture Decisions
- **Monolithic Refactoring**: Maintain current monolithic structure but optimize internal organization
- **Incremental Optimization**: Phase-based approach to avoid breaking changes
- **Chinese-First Documentation**: All new documentation in Chinese with technical term preservation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure no breaking changes to existing functionality

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **React Component Optimization**: Refactor components for better performance and maintainability
- **State Management Cleanup**: Review and optimize Redux store structure
- **UI Consistency**: Standardize Ant Design component usage patterns
- **Build Optimization**: Improve Webpack configuration for faster builds

### Backend Services  
- **FastAPI Endpoint Optimization**: Review and optimize API response times
- **Database Query Optimization**: Improve SQLite query performance
- **Service Layer Refactoring**: Clean up service dependencies and interfaces
- **Error Handling Standardization**: Consistent error response formats

### Infrastructure
- **Startup Script Optimization**: Improve application startup performance
- **Dependency Cleanup**: Remove unused npm and pip packages
- **Build Pipeline Enhancement**: Optimize build and deployment processes
- **Monitoring Setup**: Basic performance monitoring for critical paths

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning (Week 1)
- Codebase analysis and technical debt assessment
- Identify unused test files and redundant code
- Create detailed optimization plan

### Phase 2: Frontend Optimization (Week 2)  
- React component refactoring
- State management cleanup
- Build configuration optimization

### Phase 3: Backend Optimization (Week 3)
